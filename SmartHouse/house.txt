I have attended all parts of the coursework and wrote the required classes. In addition,
I created a special class for tasks, because I found this way easier to use and it 
supported looser coupling. Other additional classes are Reader – used for parsing and 
separating the input into keyword and parameters, the Interpreter – used to interpret 
a keyword, and the Creator – used to create the right object. Using the last two, it is
very easy to add newly defined appliances and their tasks to the project (we just
append them to a list and to a switch-case). My classes and use of inheritance:

Main
Reader
Interpreter
Creator
House
Meter	-ElectricMeter
		-GasMeter
		-WaterMeter

Appliance	-OneTimeAppliance	-WashingMachine
								-DishWasher
								-Kettle
								-Shower	-ElectricShower
										-PowerShower
								-Cooker -ElectricCooker
										-GasCooker
			-OnOffAppliance		-Tv
								-NightLight
			-Refrigerator
			(part of the extension from now)
			-Boiler
			-GeneratingAppliance	-SolarPanel
									-WindTurbine

People	-GrownUp
		-Child
		
Task	-OneTimeTask (WashingMachine, DishWasher, Kettle)
		-OnOffTask (Tv, NightLight)
		-DoubleApplianceTask (Shower, Cooker)		

To run my code, simply type:
	java Main [nameOfTextFile.txt]
in the command line in the same folder where the classes are compiled. If it matters, I
changed the run configurations in Eclipse to be able to do that. The file myHouse.txt
which I provided is an example of a test configuration, that can be used by typing
	java Main myHouse.txt
in the command line.
My program also writes the simulation to an output.txt (including Exception messages)
and prints on the screen the values of the meters at the end of the day.

My extension consists of an automated Boiler and two GeneratingAppliances. To simulate
a centralized heating system, I modeled the weather and the temperature in the House.
Thus, the boiler is on if the temperature in the House is below 22 degreees C. As
for the GeneratingAppliances, they depend on the weather(sunny, rainy, cloudy, windy).
If it's sunny, the SolarPanel generates electricity and if it's windy, the WindTurbine
does. This energy is then used by other appliances.
